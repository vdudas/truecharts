# Py-KMS

_py-kms_ is a port of node-kms created by [cyrozap](http://forums.mydigitallife.info/members/183074-markedsword), which is a port of either the C##, C++, or .NET implementations of KMS Emulator. The original version was written by [CODYQX4](http://forums.mydigitallife.info/members/89933-CODYQX4) and is derived from the reverse-engineered code of Microsoft's official KMS.
